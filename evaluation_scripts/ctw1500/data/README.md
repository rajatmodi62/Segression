## Dataset Information

There are two file (train) and (test) inside ROOT/data/ctw1500/. Each one has four files.

a) **text_image** contains images files.

b) **text_label_curve** cotains annotation files with suffix ".txt"
* The file name is correspoinding to image file.
* Each line of the each file represents one text region.
* Each line has 32 values, representing xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax (of the circumsribed rectangle), pw1, ph1, ..., pw14, ph14.
* For Rectangle or Quadrangle bounding box, the extra 20 offsets are automatically created, so every bounding box has 32 values.
